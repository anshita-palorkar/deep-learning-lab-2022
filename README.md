# Deep Learning Lab
#### A repository of the work done during the Deep Learning Lab as part of Semester 5, B.Tech Data Science and Engineering, MIT Manipal.
<br>
Models are built using classic Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (ex. LSTM), Pre-trained Neural Networks, etc, and trained/validated/tested on various benchmark datasets. 
<br><br>
The work involves hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation/comparison of model performance based on a range of metrics. 
<br><br>
The fundamentals of Natural Language Processing are also covered, from preprocessing and feature extraction to modelling and evaluation.
